														<p>Al Fahd Spa & Fitness Club was established in Al Fahd Plaza, Faisalabad in September 2013 with the aim of providing a world-class spa and fitness facility to the citizens of Faisalabad, combining state of the art equipment and facilities with five-star customer service.</p>

														<p>Since its inception, the Club has gone from strength to strength as we continuously add new features, ensuring our members benefit from the latest fitness trends from around the world.</p>

														<p>At Al Fahd, we guide and track the progress of our members to ensure you see an improvement in your overall health and fitness. It is our commitment to our members, together with our friendly and professional team, that has made Al Fahd Faisalabad’s favourite fitness club for ladies and gents.</p>

														<p><strong>Welcome to the concept of "Wellness"</strong></p>

														<p>Wellness is a concept that we should familiarise ourselves with. It is a step above health and fitness. It is an active process of becoming aware of and making choices towards a healthy and fulfilling life. It is "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity." — <em>World Health Organisation</em></p>

														<p><strong>Al Fahd Spa & Fitness Club is not just a gym,</strong> but is a Club which facilitates wellness, through the promotion of fitness, relaxation and social activity – all in a luxurious and welcoming environment. Our gym, spa (together with steam, sauna, jacuzzi and massage facilities) and café offer the perfect combination to help you achieve these outcomes under one umbrella.</p>
