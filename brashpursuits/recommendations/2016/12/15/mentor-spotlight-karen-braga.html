				<p>The Alexander Technique is impossible to describe if you’ve never actually experienced it. Its defining concepts are incredibly simple, but demand close and constant attention. Before studying, I knew that my technique was missing something, but I didn’t know what.</p>

<p>Since I started studying with Karen Braga, who is, in my estimation, the best acting teacher across any category that you can find in New York City, I was a smaller person. I was uninterested in re-entering the classroom, and I would describe myself loosely as “wanting to hang out and not think too hard about anything.”</p>

<p>It’s hard to speak to the work that I’ve done with Karen in any but the most tripping turns of phrase, but the results, in so far as you can even call them that, have been transformational. Other people might use words like “Zen” or “Flow,” but I won’t, because the work for me has never been as calm or relaxed as those words might suggest.</p>

<p>I struggle a lot with anxiety. It’s rare for me to traverse the hours of the day without stray thoughts of what the world will be like when I’m no longer in it. Before I met Karen, this runaway ideation could at times convince me that I didn’t even exist in the first place. I don’t know how other people deal with this nagging question of existence, but for a time I could not deal with it at all. The only way I have been able to confront it on any level is through pursuing acting. Every once in a while though, the stress of theater and film being my most active pursuit causes my nerves to unravel.</p>

<p>Karen has handed down a storied system of being to me. It’s one that helps me ease through my terrors. Not by cutting through them, not by pushing them off, not by running away from them. But just by being in them. That is a short and reductive way of describing what the Alexander Technique can do, but you’ll have to settle for it here.</p>

<p>You will have to take me at my word that Karen is as kind and gentle a teacher as I’ve ever encountered, while having a perfect understanding of when it’s appropriate to kick your ass. She does not, like so many other teachers I have had in the past, get any satisfaction from making you feel like shit about yourself or what you’re doing. She screams out in delight at least once per class. If she is intimidating, it is because she is so goddamn good at guiding you forward without needing to intimidate you in order to do it. I’ve never encountered someone else who completely does away with all the acting teacher tricks that everyone I know has their own horror stories about. </p>

<p><strong>Karen can take you places you have never been before, and what’s best, she makes you want to go there. </strong>But best of all, she leaves you with a profound sense that you are putting together a system of your own. That while she might be giving you guidance, you are still working the machinery. When you leave the room, you will be able to do everything you did in the room. She is not a guru, who you will go in debt following up to the mountain top. She is a genius who will speak to the genius in you without reserve, and leave you knowing how to have those conversations on your own.</p>

<p><em>Karen Braga currently teaches two classes a semester at <a href="http://primarystages.org/espa/acting">ESPA</a>. She also teaches in conservatories and in private.
