			<div class="article-post">
				<p>Okay you guys. I’ll come clean. I hate going to school. I had a miserable time at conservatory, and something about acting classes in general makes my skin crawl. I’m naturally a little suspicious of anyone who tells me they can teach acting who doesn’t have like, an Oscar or whatever. So trust me when I say that what you’re about to read isn’t being delivered to you lightly.</p>

<p>If you live in New York City, you should be going to ESPA. I know, I know. You don’t have the money to attend classes. You work five or more days a week at your survival job. Times are tough and the world sucks. These are all sentiments I whole-heartedly agree with, but again:</p>

<p><strong><em>If you live in New York City, you should be going to ESPA.</em></strong></p>

<p>Why am I shoving this coda down your throat so fervently? Because so many actors I meet in New York City AREN’T going to ESPA. Some of them have never even heard of it when I casually drop a “Who, me? I take classes at ESPA.” in the middle of all those casually awkward conversations actors tend to have among themselves at auditions, film shoots, and pretty much any other situation two or more actors happen to be in at once.</p>

<p>IMG</p>

<p>I started taking classes at ESPA in the summer of 2015. When I enrolled, I knew only that I wanted to take an Alexander Technique class, and that I wanted to do it as cheaply as possible. I didn’t imagine that it would be with one of the best Alexander teachers I could find, at the best school in the city. </p>

<p><em>Okay, chump. You talk a big game, but what’s so great about it?</em></p>

<p>ESPA is an interdisciplinary school. They offer classes in acting, writing, and directing. These classes are all incredibly cheap for how good they are. What’s better, the absolute saints in charge at ESPA are incredibly flexible on how you pay for those classes. I paid for my Alexander Technique class by the week, which rang up at a scant $36.25 per class, for again, the best training you can receive in the city. Add into this already amazing deal that returning students score a discount on any other classes they take, and you’re looking at the most cost-effective platform for continuing growth available.</p>

<p>The school is run out of Primary Stages, a front-runner in the New York theater scene. This means that all the education you receive is authentically curated by people who actually know something about the profession you’re pursuing. The writing teachers are accomplished playwrights and screenwriters whose works have been produced Off-Broadway and abroad. The directing teachers? Same thing. And acting, the one yours truly would be most skeptical of? You can learn the most fragile of arts from some of the foremost casting directors, actors, and theatrical geniuses in New York.</p>

<p>IMG</p>

<p>Speaking to the cost and quality alone would be enough for me to feel confident sending you on over to the official website to enroll, but I’d still be leaving out the part of the ESPA experience that really differentiates it from taking a class anywhere else. And what is that element? <strong>Community.</strong></p>

<p>The community at ESPA is second-to-none, and that’s not something an antisocial, stark raving mad, suffering artiste like myself is usually given to speak on. Even a stage whisper of the word “networking” makes me shed my outermost layer of skin and slither away like the snake I secretly am. It’s the part of the business I struggle with most, but the community at ESPA is so genuine and welcoming that no matter how brooding and intense you are, you’ll be smiling and saying hello to people who literally aren’t even in your class and maybe don’t even go to school there at all.</p>

<p>Every semester ESPA puts on a night of student-created pieces called “DETENTION.” The writing students write a short piece, the directing students direct them, and the acting students… I mean, I feel like you probably get it. This is a great way to meet people and work on something quick and dirty and a whole lot of fun, and to get your work seen by an audience of people who are generous enough to laugh even if you aren’t funny. (I’m not. So I can say that.)</p>

<p>IMG</p>

<p>A final note, as I’m sure you’re not even reading this anymore because you’ve already enrolled:</p>

<p>The staff are the most generous individuals in the world. They’re kind and charismatic, and take genuine interest in your enjoyment of their school. I’ve paid a lot more money to go other places that seemed to care about as much about my personal experience as a stag beetle cares about reading the complete works of Marcel Proust. The staff at ESPA answer all my dumb questions &amp; dumb emails, and they radiate the kind of warmth that makes you believe you should keep acting, no matter how many auditions you bombed this week. (Only two, thanks for asking.) </p>

<p>Quips aside, I have never experienced a genuine haven of the arts in the way I have experienced ESPA. I’ve grown as a human being in my short time there, and I have rarely, if ever, felt like a mere “student.” I’ve made organic connections with other artists that actually matter, as opposed to being forced to play nice with people who I share nothing in common with. The instructors have offered me free-flowing ideas and strategies for my continued success, rather than giving me paint-by-numbers systems of study that haven’t even gotten the people teaching them anywhere.</p>

<p>If there is a Heaven on Earth, its foundations rest unshakably on 38th Street.</p>
