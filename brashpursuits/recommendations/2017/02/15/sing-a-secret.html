			<div class="article-post">
				<p>I have a complicated relationship with my voice. It rarely, if ever, does exactly what I want it to. I could write an entire blog post, if not a whole book, about my particular vocal hangups. But today, I don’t have to, because I recently attended Jon Stancato’s workshop, called Sing A Secret, and I left it feeling, for the first time in a long time, a different sensation when I speak and sing.</p>

<p>In the workshop, which is currently free because Jon is a literal angel, Jon takes singers, actors, and even people who have never considered themselves singers before through a series of exercises over the course of three hours. Over the course of my life, I’ve taken a lot of classes in a three hour format, but rarely, if ever has three hours flown by so quickly.</p>

<p>Jon is the rare teacher who can combine gentle attention, concentration, and fun in a way that challenges you to step outside of your comfort zone without really feeling like he’s challenging you to do anything at all. Drawing from acting and voice teachers before him (specifically <a href="http://www.folkways.si.edu/vox-humana-alfred-wolfsohns-experiments-in-extension-of-human-vocal-range/contemporary-electronic-science-nature-sounds/album/smithsonian">Alfred Wolfsohn</a>, <a href="http://www.roy-hart-theatre.com/site/the-voice-work/">Roy Hart,</a> <a href="http://richardarmstrong.info/">Richard Armstrong,</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Towards-Poor-Theatre-Routledge-Paperback/dp/0878301550">Jerzy Grotowski,</a> and <a href="http://www.theworkcenter.org/">Thomas Richards</a>), we went through an arsenal of exercises that included rolling on the floor, playing silly characters, and  a lot of other things that to an outsider wouldn’t seem to have any real bearing on one’s ability to sing beautifully.</p>

<p>But this is where Jon’s workshop is fundamentally different from any voice lesson I’ve ever received. There is much less attention given towards any perceived goal, and more attention towards exploring, and even enjoying particular sounds as sensations, regardless of how good they sound. This freed up everyone in the room to sing at their most expressive, regardless of their individual training and experience.</p>

<p>Enough can’t be said for the environment. I always show up to these things with a lot of anxiety about the classroom as a whole, expecting everyone to be more skilled than me. But that’s simply not the environment here. Because of the specificity of the technique no comparisons can be made between students, even if you’re like me, and constantly judging yourself based on what everyone else is doing. There’s a deeply uplifting energy, and the success of others makes you want to go after your own expression more, rather than set yourself up for failure. I’ll admit, I was as self-conscious as I’ve ever been in this class, but it provides a real space to understand that there’s simply no reason to be. Jon creates an environment where artists are free to explore, and “failure” feels like it doesn’t even really exist in the walls of his classroom.</p>

<p>And it’s truly an amazing experience just watching Jon coach a singer. He can see and hear things in very subtle ways, and make very minor shifts to massive effect. He hones in on one particular detail that catches his attention, but as soon as he calls it out and directs it, entire musical vistas open up for the person singing. And it doesn’t feel, as it sometimes does in acting workshops, that Jon is just a mastermind who can command results. I left the workshop with a sense of agency over my own sound and vocal feeling that two years of very good Linklater training did not inspire in me. I have very simple tools that I can use daily, and if today’s workshop is any indicator, they are as profound as they are easy to do. </p>

<p>Given that the workshop is currently free of charge, there’s no reason not to try it out. Even if you consider yourself “a serious actor” who would “never dare do a musical,” there is a massive lesson to be learned from Jon’s work and his philosophy, not to mention you’ll have a lot of fun and feel great about yourself. In the days following the workshop, I’ve been inspired to really explore and have fun with my voice, rather than just try and “develop” it along more conventional metrics. </p>
