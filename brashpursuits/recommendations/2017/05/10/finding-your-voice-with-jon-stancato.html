			<div class="article-post">
				<p>If my <a href="/recommendations/2016/02/15/sing-a-secret.html">first article</a> about Jon Stancato’s Inside Voice workshop flew you by, consider what you’re about to read a fervent call to action. Hot off the heels of my second foray into Jon’s particular brand of vocal exploration, my entire instrument is buzzing with adventure.</p>

<p>For too long, singing and vocal training have been reduced to an incredibly small box. Do these exercises until you get this result. Take it slow to make sure you don’t hurt yourself. Look at pictures of anatomy and bang your head against the wall until you know exactly how your lungs are doing what they’re doing. Not only is it frustrating if your mind and creativity don’t work that way, it’s flat-out <em><strong>boring</strong>.</em></p>

<p>But three hours of learning to enjoy the voice with Jon go by in a flash. You imagine yourself, for a moment, in the best conservatory the world has to offer. And then you remember that it’s just one guy, doing what he loves because he loves doing it. I have never, and probably will never, be in another room where ten or fifteen people suddenly see and know each other on a completely different level than exists out there in the normal world. Sounds you have never heard before come from the deepest parts of your comrades, and rather than making you feel like you can’t match up, it spurs you on to bigger and bolder places.</p>

<p>And while the intro class was big and fun and brilliant, the second, slightly more advanced class lead the work into deeper, darker, and more intimate places. In my first three hours with Jon, I heard what sounds were possible. In the second three hours, I started to really explore sounds that were mine and only mine. Here I was also introduced to Dark Breath, a concept from Jon’s Roy Hart background. It is one of the strangest and most difficult to describe things I’ve ever done in an acting studio, but it left me with a completely different connection to breath than I’ve ever had before.</p>

<p>We also jumped into ensemble work, something I’ve always been dragged into kicking and screaming. It amazed me how easy it was to dive right into working with people whose names I didn’t even know, simply because we had already spent an hour and a half howling and yowling and elating together. There is truly a freedom of the entire being that comes from doing voice-work in this way. When a person can sound out unself-consciously, the rest of the job becomes so much easier.</p>

<p>And this carried over into my day-to-day dealings as well. I happened to schedule an audition right after the workshop, and while I intellectually wanted to be flustered rushing from one place to the next, my whole being felt so free and easy that it was impossible to really worry about it. It was easy to dive into and also throw away the big dramatic moments expected of me without really worrying if I was “selling it” or not.</p>

<p>Doing the work in this way primes you to explore on your own. It allows you to ask the question “What is my voice?” without shame or embarrassment. It helps you, in a completely safe and grounded way, completely test the limits and extremes of what a human voice can be. It reminds you that every line, every sound, every expression can be a great adventure in any direction, one that doesn’t have to be predetermined or judged for its conventional beauty, but rather experienced solely for its rawness and vitality. </p>

<p>It feels ironic that Alfred Wolfsohn first arrived at this work by hearing the sounds of people dying, when working with Jon has introduced me to what it sounds like to truly be alive.</p>
