				<p>RubberMatch begins with Nina (Meredith Owens) verbalizing the text messages she’s sending to an unknown guest. As she goes through several ritual moments in preparation to receive someone into her DUMBO apartment, we immediately get a feeling for what kind of person she is.</p>

<p>The arrival of Ceci (Kayla Jackmon), an old college girlfriend, puts Nina’s anxieties on high alert, and through the broken communications of these two old friends, an entire world is built. Other friends are discussed, past events are dredged back up into the light, and questions of identity are poked at.</p>

<p>I’ll be honest with you, these are not normally themes or ideas I’m remotely interested in while watching a play. Hearing characters talk about events that have occurred offstage feels like something reserved for Shakespeare or the Greeks, something we should’ve theatrically evolved beyond by now.</p>

<p>But, luckily, gorgeously, brilliantly, Paz Pardo’s script has taken this uneasy device and twisted it to maximum effect. All the expositional elements of the dialogue are played as that: dialogue. Despite being a two-hander, the play rarely dips into excess monologuing, and every word of it feels like a conversation you might actually hear or take part in. There’s an easy naturalism to the play, which Andrew Willis-Woodward’s direction highlights and underscores with awkward moments and breaks in connection. It all feels real enough for you to forget a lot of the time that you’re watching two actors.</p>

<p>And this for me is the play’s strongest showing. Meredith Owens gives us, as Nina, a gorgeous window into a character that is rarely represented so beautifully onstage. If only I could show all my acting teachers her performance, I might never again have to hear another speech about how “quiet characters can’t exist on stage.” Every nervous mannerism, conversational fumble, and quirky ritual is crystal clear, while still giving us plenty of space to learn about a character without beating us over the head with things we have to know. The subtlety of expression Owens employs as Nina is something I wish I could see in every play.</p>

<p>Cutting a complete contrast, Kayla Jackmon slices through the silences as Nina’s polar opposite Ceci. Espousing a brutal ex-boyfriend backstory and dying to get, you know, <em>wasted,</em> Ceci would be a tough sell for me if Jackmon didn’t bring such energy and fun to the role. Nina only really works with a brilliant counter-balance like Ceci, and Jackmon gives Owens plenty to react to, while also giving the audience her own story. The way she leads the shifting dynamics between the characters to and fro really fills out the play in the moments between the backstory.</p>

<p>And the two actors truly weave together the disjointed history of ten years prior, when both girls were in college with their two best friends Katie and Lauren. You can actually feel Katie and Lauren’s presence onstage, even though neither of the girls actually show up in the play. The way everything from back then feels related to everything happening onstage now makes the outer narrative instrumental to telling the inner one, and it’s profoundly satisfying to see a story told in this way done so right.</p>

<p>The set, which brilliantly emulates a spacious apartment in a trendy Brooklyn neighborhood, grounds the exposition in the here and now. Before the play began, seeing a light cast onstage that perfectly mimicked ambient street light coming in through a huge loft window made me nostalgic for my own apartment, and there’s something very familiar yet completely menacing about the void of the all white apartment the stage has become. Designers Peiyi Wong, Jason Fok, and Cherie A. Roberts set a bar of stylish realism, and the actors look completely at home playing around in it. I’m also pretty overjoyed about the play’s unlikely inclusion of an Elvis tune, but I won’t spoil it.</p>

<p>RubberMatch manages to strike chords all across the theatrical piano, with uproariously funny moments intertwined with quiet, sweet, and tragic ones as well. Rather than cling to any particular genre rules, it strives first and foremost towards the organic, with moments evolving out of each other in a way that feels both beautiful and desperate. The awkward-comedic tensions of its first half are replaced by a needy anxiety that pulls you in different directions, and the play’s lack of concern for filling in the blanks is what makes it a true joy to watch. The ending, by the way, is masterful.</p>
