				<p>About a month or two ago I shot a film with the youth outreach program Mythic Bridge, in collaboration with the Boy Scouts of America. While I could probably write an entire novel about how necessary I think Mythic Bridge is as a structure in the film community, I’m focusing here today on a particular opportunity that I had while working with them.</p>

<p><em><strong>Before that day of shooting, I had never been on green screen before.</strong></em></p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/147924858" width="100%" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>You can watch the video above and tell pretty clearly what I was asked to do on green screen. I won’t vouch for the quality of my performance. Everyone involved (including the kids) was much more talented than I am, and I feel overwhelmingly lucky to have been a part of it. </p>

<p>But I learned certain things that day that will greatly help my career going forward, as no classroom I’ve ever been in has even remotely addressed the question of acting in the age of CGI. It’s easy to write off the performances in comic book and blockbuster action movies as “easy” or “dumb.” But try acting on green screen once or twice, and you’ll suddenly realize how much those actors really sell everything, regardless of the fact that they only have the script and their imaginations to work with in a lot of scenarios.</p>

<p>Working with another actor provides its own list of challenges: listening, responding, etc. etc. These are things you could drill in a Meisner program for two or three years and still not get right. But what do you do when the other actor you’re working with is supposed to be a giant tree, or an alien super soldier, or… I don’t know, a spaceship? How can you create a believable and human performance in the face of the pure technical vacuum needed to facilitate CGI? Well…</p>

<p><strong>1. Be Willing To Look Very Stupid. </strong>Review any behind the scenes footage of any movie since Lord Of The Rings and you’ll admit that the actors occasionally look very, very goofy in actuality. You’ll sometimes be asked to do things that might not make any sense in the moment, but you can rest assured that somewhere, some technical wizard will spin whatever you do into filmic gold. I spent the first 10-20 minutes of our allotted green screen hour just getting over the nerves of people watching me flail about like a moron. Get over yourself, and give them whatever they want. Which leads me to…</p>

<p><strong>2. Trust More. </strong>It’s not always easy to take every note, to make every adjustment, or to justify every character decision. Actors everywhere, myself included, have a tendency to hold onto “character decisions,” “beats,” and “moments.” But in these instances of intensive CGI, you have to trust that pretty much everybody else knows how it’ll turn out a lot better than you do. Do what they tell you, when they tell you, and don’t overthink it. You’re in a scene that is primarily a visual composition, not a “raw” acting moment. Trust what people see from the outside, and be willing to paint their picture. I.E…</p>

<p><strong>3. Go All Out. </strong>I’m big into naturalistic acting. I hate watching people send a moment sailing way over the top, especially if they don’t have any emotional core to back it up. But, if there’s any time to give it your all and go soaring past all the walls, it’s when you’re in front of a green screen. The subtle reactions in character-to-character scenes simply don’t work as well when you’re supposed to be reacting to a 100 foot tall version of yourself inside a video game. Like, not at all.</p>

<p><strong>4. Let The World Carry You. </strong>You’re standing in front of a green tarp, or maybe the room is painted green. You might even have a mo-cap suit on. In a certain sense, this can become the least imaginative position an actor can find themselves in. You have nothing but yourself to hook you in. BUT, that means that ultimately, you can imagine the world around you. You can see anything you want, and as long as you react to it, a ton of other geniuses (who work a lot harder than you do) will fill it in later with whatever they actually want. Make your job as easy as possible, and it will make theirs easier too.</p>

<p>Look, I’m still fairly new at this, so this is one of the places where I’m really not going to act like I know what I’m talking about. But watching this film back with the special effects all in place, I can immediately identify a few ways I could’ve done my own job better, especially given how much everyone else knocked this thing out of the park. A lot of it comes down to self-consciousness, and the misconception that I have to take my job “seriously” in order to do good work. Lighten up, give it your all, and commit fully to being one hand in building an insane world. </p>
