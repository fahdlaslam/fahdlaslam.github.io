				<p>Temping might seem pretty low on the totem pole when compared to say, shooting a feature film. I certainly learned a hell of a lot when I shot my first feature length movie. But, it’s possible I learned just as much from being a two-day temp at a commercial casting office. I know, it sounds strange. I mean, what could you possibly learn from doing the rank and file work that any actor, regardless of talent level, could do? </p>

<p>A great deal, when you factor in how many different actors I actually saw over that two day period.</p>

<p>I was tasked with working three different commercial castings. Two split across the first work day, and one that took up the entire second day. In that time, I must’ve seen about fifty to a hundred actors, most coming in to tape for the same role. As someone who had only been introduced to the CD on duty on my first day of work, I was of course not privy to any final casting decisions, but I left with a pretty firm hunch about who landed what work.</p>

<p>So what did I observe?</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Pretty much everyone did stellar, professional work.</strong> With a few minor exceptions, everyone came in at a baseline level of preparedness. They weren’t memorized, but the actors almost all had a certain level of skill manipulating the text. A lot of them seemed right for the job, and a lot of them displayed the skills to take it.</li>
  <li><strong>Those who were able to let go of their preparation and just have fun were strongly rewarded for it. </strong>Whatever ideas the actors came in with about the job they were doing, the ones who the CDs responded to the most were the ones who seemed to genuinely enjoy being there, and to be able to quickly snap into whatever the CD wanted, regardless of how much objective sense it made.</li>
  <li><strong>Confidence went a lot further than looks.</strong> This one was the most shocking to me. Some incredibly handsome men and women showed up to these castings, but the CDs responded much more to a few less conventionally attractive people who walked in the door already on fire. In fact, some of the less dynamic actors seemed to be able to dominate the room simply by using affability and charm outside of the work.</li>
  <li><strong>Different choices, good or bad, made people stand out. </strong>All of the actors I saw gave good, castable performances. The real problem was, a lot of them gave similar performances. The actors who chose to do something differently, regardless of how effective it might’ve actually been in the particular moment, stuck out more than the ones who didn’t. Period. </li>
  <li><strong>I could usually tell by the slate-in how well an actor was going to do. </strong>A lot of people showed up outside the casting with a ton of energy. But once they had their digital taken and took their slate, they had already reinforced the wall of “show business.” </li>
</ol>

<p>I bring these points up for a very specific reason. As an actor, I have a tendency to think about auditions along a very specific metric. One that usually looks like “Did I do all my homework? Have I fully made myself <em>right</em> for the role?” If I don’t land a part, I usually assume it was because someone else more handsome showed up, or looked <em>right</em> for the part and got it.</p>

<p>The thing is, a lot of the names buzzing on the associates’ lips didn’t belong to people who looked the way you imagined they would when you read the copy. Some of them didn’t even play the scene in the way the copy <em>suggested.</em> One guy, who I’m almost sure got the job, didn’t even come off as professional in the way I usually assume actors must be in the auditioning room. He simply made himself known, took directions, and was totally unafraid to say or do whatever he was feeling. </p>

<p>I think the real problem lies in actors having a very particular definition of what an audition is and should be. It’s handed down from actor to actor at every school across the country. You can read about it in hundreds of books and ebooks about show business. The thing to remember is that with a few rare exceptions, you’re hearing how to audition from someone who has never landed a major audition, or maybe they’ve landed one or two. Brad Pitt certainly doesn’t come out and say how he consistently lands work over and over again. Bankable actors usually don’t even seem able to speak to how they nail an audition. So why trust anybody?</p>

<p>Why not spend some time on the other side of the table, and see what things are like from the CD’s perspective. The second you do, it becomes a lot easier to analyze your own audition behavior, and see how you might be tripping yourself up. I was certainly able to glean more about the process than I did in school simply by shadowing a professional for a couple of days.</p>
