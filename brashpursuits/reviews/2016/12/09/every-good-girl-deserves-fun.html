				<p>Every Good Girl Deserves Fun is a play about Alzheimer’s. It’s also a play about family. You could even say it’s a play about the dilemma of health care, like, how do we really give anybody the kind of care they deserve, especially if we can no longer tell if they’re “all there?” You could give the play a lot of labels, but at every corner, it refuses to be boxed in.</p>

<p>Written by Heidi Armbruster and directed by Michelle Bossy, the play stars five women and one man. Yes, you read those numbers right. That’s because one of the primary tenants of Clutch Productions, the creative collective of theatrical trailblazers responsible for bringing you this play, is giving women a stronger voice in the American Theater. As if that wasn’t enough to rally your sympathies, the play also bravely endeavors to raise awareness about Alzheimer’s. </p>

<p><em>Okay. Great. It has a positive message. I’m on board. But is the play any fun to watch?</em></p>

<p>Well, yeah. While I’d love to come off as one of those socially conscious heroes who rallies for change across every metric, I’m not. No matter how well-intentioned a play is, it still has to be profoundly entertaining if my dwindling attention span is going to survive its declared run-time. And the good news is, Every Good Girl Deserves Fun, on top of being a remarkably important theatrical experience, is a remarkably fun one.</p>

<p>It doesn’t hurt that all five actresses are at the top of their game. Christianne Greiert and Amy Kirsten play sisters who find themselves growing increasingly unsure of their aging mother’s quality of life. The two find an effortless kind of sisterhood on stage, with a constant back and forth that feels connected at every moment. Miranda Noelle Wilson plays Liz, who’s in charge of the Alzheimer’s Unit at the local hospital. As someone with a rigorously cynical view of the current healthcare system, it was strangely cathartic to find myself rooting for someone so heavily inundated in it, which is due in no small part to Wilson’s one-two punch of vulnerability and charisma. Marinda Anderson plays Toni, a no-nonsense nurse with a soft spot for her patients, and her keen sense of humor brings a much-needed level of lightheartedness to compliment the play’s heavier moments. And of course, Stephen Stocking’s charming turn as Will gives us plenty of space to admire the male element of the play, where subtle romance  adds texture to the lives of the play’s female characters, rather than boxing them in.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/every-good-girl-deserves-fun-1.jpg" alt="every-good-girl-deserves-fun-1" /></p>

<p>But the real linchpin of any play about Alzheimer’s will of course be the performance of the character who actually has it. I walked into this play very nervous about this element. I mean, how awful was I going to feel if I didn’t buy it? Luckily, Jennifer Dorr White’s turn as Martha wholly saved me the grief of feeling like a complete asshole for an hour and a half. It’s incredibly easy to get lost in what she’s doing at any given moment she walks onstage, and you can feel the genuine and necessary fear that this could eventually happen to you or anyone you know in every scene she comes into. The kind of bravery and commitment it takes to step into a role like this one is such that I don’t feel too comfortable saying much more about what Jennifer Dorr White has done, because I simply don’t know how she did it.</p>

<p>With an engaging plot and a frankness of dialogue that really lets you forget you’re watching a play, playwright Heidi Armbruster manages to let many different interests collide in a play that never reduces itself to being only about one thing. Whereas a single decent female role would feel like an oasis in the desert in another play, Heidi has effortlessly thrown five great ones into play at once to gorgeous effect. The subtle layering in of life in a small town helps to make the world of the play feel lived in and immediate, and gives the play’s characters an avenue to say things that might feel pointlessly poetic in another play in a way that feels necessary and natural here.</p>

<p>Michelle Bossy’s direction is so deft that it becomes almost impossible to speak to. She gives the actors room to live out the lives of their characters on the stage, and there’s not a single moment you can pin down as the director or the actor’s choice. Things happen with an immediacy that you’d swear was meticulously crafted, but there’s so many little organic things happening in their own perfect way that you can really believe you’re seeing a work of art happening for the first time ever. </p>

<p>The stage picture designed by Stephen Dobay and sound design by Janie Bullard give you just enough to suggest an atmosphere without immediately telling you how to feel. One of my favorite moments of the play, set in the bar where Will works, featured the two sisters at each other’s throats while a classic Ja Rule song softly intoned in the background. This is the sort of juxtaposition an overly pretentious white kid in his twenties could really go on about in his review after the fact, but in the moment it almost brought a tear to my eye, because I thought “Oh yeah, I know that.” </p>

<p>And that’s what is really special about the play. It ropes you in to feeling painfully close to its subject matter, while giving you the luxury of spasmodic laughter at the way its characters sometimes behave. It takes you by the hand into what would otherwise be incredibly fraught territory and says “Hey, it’s okay, we’re all alive here.” And that, for me, is the most important thing a play can do.</p>

<p><em>Every Good Girl Deserves Fun continues its opening run until December 20th, 2015.
