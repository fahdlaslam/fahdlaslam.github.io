				<p>When we talk about a piece of experimental theater, it’s often helpful to identify what the experiment is. After all, how can we judge a work’s success if we don’t know what it’s actually trying to achieve?</p>

<p>With Human Head’s new play Due To Events, I can only assume the experiment is something like “How many times can a human being laugh in an hour and a half before their head completely explodes?” </p>

<p>The darkly comic journey of one woman (Anne Gridley) and one cat (Laura Campbell) through an interminable period of house arrest is, from its opening moments onward, remarkably funny. Aided (and annoyed) on their journey by a bumbling lawyer (Ben Beckley) and a sinister food delivery man (David Skeist, who also provides voice-over narration), the duo slowly descend into the kind of madness that can only be visited in this kind of theater.</p>

<p>To give away any more of the form of the show would be spoiling part of what makes it so much fun to watch, so instead I’ll talk about the four actors and how great they are, because you could do your graduate’s thesis on the acting in this show and still want to keep talking about it.</p>

<p>From the moments the play begins, David Skeist takes us by the hand and eagerly drags us into the show’s metaphysical space. He assures us with his mannerisms that there will be plenty to laugh about. But his words, spoken with the kind of veracity that the rest of us can only aspire to, are foreboding somehow. And it’s that sense of foreboding that, no matter how funny the play ever gets, never leaves.  The fact that Skeist can make the play’s peppering of late night radio-esque soliloquys about existential pain as funny as they are anxiety-inducing is the kind of speaking we come to the theater hoping we’ll hear. His various turns as incidental bit characters also glue the comedy of the play together impeccably. </p>

<p>Laura Campbell plays a cat. And she does it so well you have to wonder after a certain point if she isn’t ACTUALLY a cat who has somehow come into ownership of a human form that is capable of every subtlety and explosion of movement one could ask for onstage. Rather than simply watching an actor go through the motions of an animal exercise, we’re seeing something olympic happening. If the text of the show ever loses you in its dreamy metaphysics, it doesn’t take long for the cat to do something insane. The movements of the role are so deftly performed it’s almost like watching Chaplin or Buster Keaton in real life. Only they’re trapped inside a David Lynch movie. Or something. And in case seeing an actor flawlessly embody a cat onstage wasn’t enough for you, she talks. It’s great.</p>

<p>Ben Beckley’s turn as a hapless lawyer gives us someone in the play who is as confused as we are. He tries to do his job right, but it sends him on a globetrotting quest of vignettes where he never quite manages to fit in or say the right thing, no matter what locale he’s in. In a play full of philosophy and smart ideas, farces and wild jokes, it helps to have someone who can’t quite cope with it all. His ability to keep a straight face and go with exactly whatever he’s doing regardless of how much the audience is laughing is astounding, especially since he was only about eight feet away from me on one of his first entrances and I was laughing so hard I thought they might kick me out of the theater.</p>

<p>Anne Gridley plays Hero, the woman exiled to her living room on account of court proceedings that do not seem to be going particularly well. Anne’s ability to let us see her character’s descent in pure gradient, rather than through carefully studied dramatic beats, allows us to never know exactly how mad she’s gone, and consequently how mad we might be for thinking she’s still sane. If there is anything I hate more than actors “playing crazy,” I don’t know what it is, and the fact that Anne never gives us a straight answer or shows us how we should feel about her outright makes the play infinitely more of an exciting puzzle to solve.</p>

<p>And that’s what makes the play so much more fun than more standard theatrical fare. It plays with various levels of audience engagement, making us want to figure out how things will develop by dangling the narrative string in front of us and making us chase it.</p>

<p>The play also oozes atmosphere, with an eerie set designed by Sara Walsh, and lighting by Simon Harding. Chris Chappell provides an underscore of jazz, ambient, and experiential sounds that really excite me for the possibilities of sound design for the stage. David Lynch’s best works come alive due in no small part to Angelo Badalamenti’s sound work, and Chris Chappell’s work here help underscore the laughs with that intangible creepy crawly feeling in much the same way. </p>

<p>When watching a play this impeccably acted, it’s hard to talk about the writing and the directing, because so much of the experience seems like the actors are four geniuses coming up with it all on the spot. Given the smooth operation of the whole show, one can barely imagine how it was all written down in the first place, and it’s even tougher to imagine what the process of putting it on stage was like. It’s truly the kind of magical experience that we can only arrive at in the theater, and we have to be grateful to Jean Ann Douglass and Eric John Meyer for giving it to us without any creative reservations.</p>

<p>It makes the difficult easy, and turns the existential howling to laughter. A must see if ever there was one.</p>

<p><em>DUE TO EVENTS runs at The Brick Theater in Brooklyn until February 27th.
