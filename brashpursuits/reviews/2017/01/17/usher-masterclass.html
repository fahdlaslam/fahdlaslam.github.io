				<p>I wouldn’t categorize myself as much of an Usher fan. I can easily recognize that he has a lot of catchy, hit songs. He just doesn’t really work in a style of music I get down with. But, after how much I loved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409194553/http://www.brashpursuits.com/blog/2015/12/9/is-dustin-hoffman-masterclass-worth-it">Dustin Hoffman’s MasterClass</a>, I was eager to try out Usher’s.</p>

<p>Not having any idea what to expect, I was genuinely surprised by how inspiring Usher’s MasterClass ended up being for me as an actor. While a lot of the advice is for singers and dancers, just as much of it can be applied to any particular art form you practice, which is what I think make’s the class so useful. Early on, Usher talks about how to recognize your influences and build your own style from them. In later lessons, he gives pointers on how to develop that style even further.</p>

<p>I could summarize a lot of what he has to say here, but what makes Usher’s online course so special is the way he tells it. He’s very candid and freeflowing with his ideas, and he has no problem bragging about his successes and the things he did to get there. It’s a very down to Earth style of presentation, despite how much glitz and glamour the production values pack in. Aside from Dustin Hoffman’s course, it’s probably the first and only online class I’ve taken that is entertaining from start to finish.</p>

<p>But while being entertained and inspired are both buzzy, positive feelings, they won’t necessarily move your career forward. My favorite parts of this MasterClass are the ones where Usher speaks frankly about the amount of work it has taken him to get where he is, and the amount of work it will take any would-be artist to become the performer and entertainer that they want to be. He’s not at all pretentious about this area of entertainment, but he is very real when he talks about motivation and drive, and that’s something that I think is worth the price of entry alone.</p>

<p>While it’s easy to watch episode after episode of this MasterClass because it’s so captivating, it also contains many longterm goals and challenges for artists to think about. Usher also offers up plenty of opportunities for students to post their work to the MasterClass page and critique each other. I didn’t access this feature, since I’m not a singer or a dancer, but the ways in which Usher has chosen to utilize the specific medium he’s teaching in are a lot more inspired than I expected. A later episode even urges students to reach out to each other and start collaborating on songs, which I think is an incredible use of the forum. </p>

<p>If you find yourself consistently questioning what kind of artist you are and what kind of artist you want to be, Usher’s MasterClass provides a very simple, very streamlined way of looking at what you’re doing now, and immediately taking steps to grow and get better. The insights on display come from someone with a lot of career under their belt, and I think it’s a very rare opportunity for performers to hear firsthand from a mentor what it’s like to perform for audiences of hundreds and thousands.</p>
